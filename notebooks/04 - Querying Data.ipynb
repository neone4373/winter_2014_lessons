The Coast Guard has established a national network of AIS receivers that provides coverage of nearly all U.S. waters. AIS signals are transmitted several times each minute and the network is capable of handling thousands of reports per minute and updates as often as every two seconds. Therefore, a typical voyage in our study might include the transmission of hundreds or thousands of AIS encoded signals. This provides a rich source of spatial data that includes both spatial and temporal information.\n",
